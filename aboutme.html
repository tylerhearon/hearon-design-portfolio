about-section1: As soon as I could hold a pencil, I was drawing. I was inspired by everything, but my favourite subjects were animals, and the characters from beloved Disney classic films with anything I could get my hands on. <br><br>My passion only grew through elementary, where I was constantly doodling. Even through other activities, such as an early love for reading, and a growing interest in video games, my imagination was constantly engaged.
about-section2: Through earlier versions of Photoshop, I began to experiment at home as a young teen. I soon grew to love digital media and expression as much as I did the traditional, but in spite of this, chose initially to pursue my other interest, inspired by my love of animals - Biology.<br><br> It was after several years that I began to turn, in need of something new. Through all of the successes and challenges, I have been on this path ever since.
